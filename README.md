## Introduction
This repo holds the exercises while walking through the [Essential Scala](https://underscore.io/books/essential-scala)
book to learn Scala programming:
- Solutions for exercises from Chapter 1-7 with unit tests.
- Unit tests for almost all exercises with [Scalatest](https://www.scalatest.org/)
- `sbt` build system used to build & test the exercises.

Exercises are formatted with `scalafmt`

## But the solutions are already given
While the solutions are provided with the book, this repo could prove useful as guide
on the missing parts:
- How to write tests for exercises with Scalatest to make sure that they work.
- How to setup `sbt` to build and test your exercises.
